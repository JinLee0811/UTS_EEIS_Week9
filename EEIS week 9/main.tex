\section{Question 1}
\subsection{Social Media as a Business Enhancer: Practical Applications in Amazon, Local Dining, and Startups}
\label{sec:Question 1}

Social media applications provide a plethora of advantages for businesses, acting as pivotal tools in modern marketing, customer engagement, and brand development strategies. Their value lies in their ability to facilitate rapid communication, extend market reach, and tailor content to diverse consumer segments. Here, I will elaborate on how three distinct types of businesses—e-commerce, local restaurants, and technology startups—utilize social media platforms to enhance their business models \citep{question_1.1}.\\

\noindent \textbf{E-commerce Businesses: Amazon}\\
Amazon, a global leader in e-commerce, leverages platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to enhance customer interaction and drive sales. These platforms are utilized to advertise products, interact with customers, and handle service inquiries. Instagram, with its visual focus, is particularly effective for showcasing products through high-quality images and stories, which can directly lead users to Amazon’s product pages \citep{question_1.2}. Additionally, Twitter serves as a real-time service channel, where Amazon addresses customer complaints and queries, fostering a responsive brand image. \\

\noindent \textbf{Local Restaurants: A Local Bistro}\\
Local restaurants, such as a hypothetical bistro in a city center, commonly use platforms like Instagram and Facebook to attract customers. Instagram offers a visual showcase of the restaurant's dishes and ambiance, appealing directly to the sensory interests of potential patrons. Special promotions, menu updates, and events are regularly posted to both Instagram and Facebook, drawing in local clientele. Moreover, user-generated content, such as reviews and tagged photos, boosts their social proof and visibility, essentially providing free advertising and credibility enhancement \citep{question_1.3}. \\

\noindent \textbf{Technology Startups: A Tech Startup}\\
Technology startups often rely on LinkedIn and Twitter to build their brand and attract both customers and potential investors. LinkedIn helps in establishing credibility, networking with industry professionals, and recruiting talent. It serves as a platform for sharing professional content, industry insights, and company news, which are crucial for B2B engagement. Twitter, on the other hand, allows startups to engage in industry conversations, monitor trends, and respond quickly to market changes, thereby maintaining relevance and thought leadership in fast-evolving sectors \citep{question_1.4}.\\

\noindent \textbf{Conclusion}\\
In conclusion, social media platforms are indispensable in the digital age for businesses seeking to expand their market presence, engage effectively with customers, and continually adapt to consumer preferences. By leveraging the specific strengths of each social media platform, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies and enhance their overall competitive advantage.\\

\end{itemize}


\noindent\textbf{Intangible Measures}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Brand Perception} \\
    \noindent Crisis Management and Brand Sentiment: Following a crisis involving employee misconduct, Domino's adept use of social media to address the issues transparently helped to salvage and subsequently enhance brand perception. This strategic response not only contained the potential backlash but also demonstrated Domino's commitment to corporate responsibility and customer respect \citep{question_2.3}.\\
    
    \item \textbf{Customer Engagement Innovation}\\
    \noindent Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Domino's has tailored its social media strategies to resonate with specific demographics, such as Gen Z. The Valentine's Day ``\#SayItWithAPizza" campaign effectively tapped into the modern dating narratives prevalent among young adults, using pizzas as a medium for expression. This campaign was particularly successful in engaging its intended audience by aligning the product with contemporary social trends and communication styles \citep{question_2.4}.\\

    \item \textbf{Analytics and Strategic Insights}\\
    \noindent Adaptability and Market Insights: By analyzing social media data, Domino's gains valuable insights into consumer behavior, preferences, and trends.

\section{Question 3}
\subsection{Assessing Cloud Technology: Key Players and Constraints in Today's Market}
\subsubsection{Dell (www.dell.com)} 

\noindent\textbf{Offerings} 

\noindent Dell is an information technology (IT) company that provides desktops, computers, tablets, and even software to support their hardware product. Their website focuses on selling their services: laptops, desktops, monitors, PC accessories, APEX Multicloud \& aaS, IT infrastructure, AI solutions, and many more. Their cloud service, the website, is constructed using major programming languages such as HTML, ASP.NET, PHP, and JavaScript, with the help of frameworks such as Bootstrap and the location of their server is in the United States \citep{question_3.1}. Regarding the website trend, according to the website traffic chart, their estimated visitor have fluctuated over the years with the highest number of visitors of around 96 million website visitors in November 2023, believed as the effect of the Latitude artificial intelligence computer. The lowest web visitor of Dell dropped to less than 65M in August 2023 \citep{question_3.2}. Dell focuses on research and development for its products and services and always tries to give diverse products to market around the different geographic in the world. The company has made almost 90 million us dollars in revenue by the end of the February 2024 financial year which should able for more innovation in the products and services it offers \citep{question_3.1}.\\

\noindent\textbf{Inhibitors }\\
Dell faces some strong competitors such as Acer, HP, Samsung, Lenovo, and many more. Also as an international computer provider, the company also must deal with many stringent regulations that differ for each country and has to create different websites for every region/area. As one of the massive IT companies, the risk complexity of their IT system and website is also increasing. Although the revenue was produced, the company also struggled with huge debt due to massive operations and development worldwide \citep{question_3.1}. Another challenge is that nowadays many customers want to shop using third-party or online shop providers such as Amazon, which threatens the number of visitors to the Dell official website. Also, the website visitors mostly only increases when there is a new product being launched and hyped in the market.\\

\subsubsection{Oracle (www.oracle.com)} 
\noindent\textbf{Offerings}\\
\noindent Oracle is a company that offers cloud computing businesses access to web resources and products to help traditional businesses solve problems via the cloud (internet) including servers, storage, databases, and software. The website of Oracle primarily focuses on promoting its main service, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) which consists of, but is not limited to AI and machine learning, database services, distributed cloud, big data, integration, and many more. Oracle has the experience to help more than 30,000 organizations worldwide to help their business run through the cloud, including Toyota, FedEx, Spotify, Lyft, Dropbox, and many more. Their website lists all the products, support \& services, customers \& partners, and a developer resource center to help with their OCI operations. OCI offers enterprise customers high performance, greater scalability, more security, better availability, professional error recovery, and even industry-specific solutions to be easily integrated with effective cost.\\
 
\noindent\textbf{Inhibitors}\\
\noindent The website is primarily about providing business-to-business solutions and could have many technical and business terms used. Therefore, it is quite difficult for people who are new to Oracle to use those services without sufficient IT support to set up and use them effectively. The variety of specific cloud solutions makes the cost unpredictable, this can lead to unexpected bills when need to use another service that might not included in the current plan. This is because, Oracle uses pay-as-you-go-pricing, so customers will be charged an invoice will be issued \citep{question_3.3}. Another thing to consider is that OCI, in the cloud service market, has other big rivals such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Microsoft Azure which are more well-known in the market. This could make certain businesses choose more established providers over OCL.\\

\subsubsection{IBM (www.ibm.com)} 
\noindent\textbf{Offerings}\\
\noindent IBM is also another cloud computing services provider to help with the needs of diverse industries. But currently, IBM shifting to structure a more hybrid design that accommodates AI-ready and secure solutions for extensive enterprise applications. IBM offers various service models such as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service) to help their clients transition to the cloud. IBM offers help the company to have maximum performance, ensure durability, and enhance security as IBM worked with many vital organizations that have strict regulatory standards, Innovative AI Technologies embedded with its cloud-native system protection, and flexible solutions with variety of computing options to meet the fluctuating business demand. IBM has helped many big players in business such as American Airlines to successfully migrate their critical business operations to the IBM cloud, to enhance performance capabilities with its scalable infrastructure that IBM has promised.\\

\noindent\textbf{Inhibitors}\\
\noindent One of the challenges IBM faces is the integration complexity with existing IT infrastructures that might not be compatible and require intensive resources to make which can be a big consideration for a company to transition to fully cloud services. The pricing structure is still challenging to estimate the actual costs accurately. Market competition from other cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, which are also dominant players in the cloud solution providers. Due to the complexity of user requirements, the solutions provided by IBM also need to be improved or customized by creating rules and configurations so the function will go far beyond its template \citep{question_3.4} which can also add more cost to the transitioning process.\\  

\subsubsection{Amazon (www.amazon.com)} \\
\noindent\textbf{Offerings}\\
\noindent AWS provides cloud computing, which consists of SaaS, LaaS, and PaaS.\\ 
User-friendly: AWS has provided a platform where users can access other SaaS services. On the other hand, users can utilise the software or services without any technical knowledge \citep{question_3.5}. Moreover, users can modify the services based on their specialisations, such as operating systems, web application platforms, and databases. This modification provides the alternative to solve or enhance business activities at Glace \citep{question_3.6}. In addition, to use the services, users are required to pay for computing power, which means It is not necessary to have an infrastructure to access the services \citep{question_3.6}. \\

\noindent\textbf{Inhibitors }\\
\noindent AWS mostly relies on massive technology, which causes them to need much funding to maintain their outstanding services. Meanwhile, from the user’s side, they have considered the risk that can happen during the migration from another to AWS \citep{question_3.7}. Consisting of Fear of data loss, they are concerned about the consequences of losing critical data while they are transiting to AWS, which causes loss of customer trust \citep{question_3.7}. 
Unfamiliarity with the migration process: Understanding complex details is one of the obstacles to migration, which AWS cannot omit. Mistakes in the implementation of the data create damage to the organisation \citep{question_3.7}.


\subsubsection{Microsoft (www.microsoft.com) } 
\noindent\textbf{Offerings}\\
Users can access the platform or services like storage at ease. In addition, the platform is designed for users to utilise without coding. Moreover, Azure has provided tools for users to apply functions such as source control, unit testing, and integration testing \citep{question_3.8}. Users pay for a fixed amount of their services instead of investing in IT infrastructure and development. This creates ways of operating for businesses with limited budgets to develop their projects \citep{question_3.8}. On top of that, Azure is flexible enough for engineers to develop software using their own language \citep{question_3.8}.\\

\noindent\textbf{Inhibitors }\\
Inhibitors: Microsoft Azure requires an expert to operate the platform \citep{question_3.8}, and it is necessary for users either to understand the service process or to hire professionals for a specific purpose \citep{question_3.9}. Moreover, expertise is crucial to ensure the maximisation of the potential of tools and services so that every feature is related together instead of using tools that they are not familiar with. Azure provides high-speed services. Meanwhile, in some regions, the speed to access data tends to be slower \citep{question_3.9}.


\subsubsection{Google (www.google.com) } 
\noindent\textbf{Offerings}\\
Offering: Google Cloud Platform specialises in premium quality computing, such as machine learning, analytics, and big data, which can offer outstanding options to customers \citep{question_3.10}. Understanding the requirements for high-performance data centres makes Google Cloud offer the fastest response time compared to others \citep{question_3.10}. Due to economies of scale, the Google app engine helps to minimise configurations of servers that require few people to operate \citep{question_3.11}. Google Cloud offers users everywhere access to the services without boundaries via web-based apps. On top of that, Users are allowed to collaborate on the project at the same time while data are stored in the cloud instead of personal computers. Interestingly, users have authority over Google apps to transfer their data from the cloud anytime \citep{question_3.11}. \\

\noindent\textbf{Inhibitors }\\
Due to the complexity of the Google Cloud Platform, it is quite difficult for businesses to clearly determine the expenditure of services \citep{question_3.12}. The complexity that occurs from the pricing of a virtual machine (VM) does not encompass elements consisting of storage and bandwidth \citep{question_3.12}. Google has outstanding infrastructure, but in part of innovation, it does not keep its pace fast enough to compete with competitors such as AWS. The options for customisation are limited for users, which might not be enough to enhance performance. In addition, Users may encounter the issue when unfamiliar with Google Cloud \citep{question_3.13}.
